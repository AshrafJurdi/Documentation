# Project Name 
Hypnotic Clinic Booking System

## Overview 
This application provides patients with the ability to book appointments in the clinic online with their preferred hypnosis specialists. The clinic has different specialized hypnotherapists with different levels of experience. The opening hours are from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm Monday-Friday. Sessions are one hour each.

## Goal 

Develop an application that allows users to easily view hypnotherapists, be able to login and view, edit or delete booked appointments and be able to book new appointments as smoothly as possible. 

## Basic Requirements: (Listing Hypnotherapists)

#### Home Page

- Introduction to the clinic
- A list of all the clinic's hypnotherapists (image, name, specialization). Each should be linked to a more detailed view.

#### Hypnotherapist Profile Page

- A detailed view of the hypnotherapist with an image, name, specialization, phone number, email, experience level, price per one hour session.

## Optional 1: (Adding user login and booking appointments functionality)

#### Patient Profile Page

- Login/Logout 
- User name welcome message
- List of all booked appointments with the ability to delete or edit.

#### Book an appointment Page
- Available for a logged in user.
- Ability to book an appointment at a specific date and specific time with a specific doctor. 

## Optional 2: (Constraints)

- A patient should not be able to book an appointment in a time slot where the hypnotherapist is unavailable (i.e booked by someone else). An error should be displayed
- Add a suggestion of other available hypnotherapists with same specializations, or display other times in the same day that are not booked for this hypnotherapist.

## Optional 3: (Adding Rooms)

- Add the option of booking appointments in specific rooms (The clinic has 5 available rooms). This means you also need to take into consideration that a room is not already reserved in that time slot.

## Optional 4: (Make it look good)

- Display the appointments in a calender format.
- Create headers/footer
- Be creative
