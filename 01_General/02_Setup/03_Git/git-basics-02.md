# Git Basics 02

As you have learned previously with Git basic 01. You can create local directory to keep track of your changes.
But what if you want to work in team ? Or remotely ?

Several solution exists, Most common and fairly free to use are Github & Gitlab.

You can research about Github vs Gitlab. here are some links.

* [Gitlab (Github Vs Gitlab)](https://about.gitlab.com/devops-tools/github-vs-gitlab.html)
* [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/github-vs-gitlab-which-is-better-for-open-source-projects-31c45d464be0)
* [Google](https://www.google.com)

Keep in mind that the online platform such as Github and GitLab still use Git system. You will **not** work directly on the website. You will **keep** working with command lines as [git basic 01](./git-basics-01.md) thought you.
But instead to **push** your change localy, you will **push** them online so you or someone else can view/retrieve them easly.

> During your **Codi training** you will use Github. Why ? Because Github provide us with certain solutions such as Gitbook and bigger exposure on the internet for potential employers.

## Codi Tech
At Codi we have our own organization hosted on github : [CodiTech](www.github.com/coditech)

It contains multiple repositories. These are the main ones :
* Documentation 
> This is for Gitbook, All of the documentation files are hosted there. You will not need to **fork** this.
* Submission Folder
> this will be the main repository for your exercises and challenges.
* Team Projects (e.g. Prefab-Houses)
> Certain team projects will require you to **fork** additional repository team project are some of them.

What is fork ? [Secret](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)

#### Important Brief 
the difference between remote and local git is that you are **not** going to use **.git init**. Instead you are going to use clone.

1. CLONE : This is how you get the files on your computer.
2. FORK : With any online version control manager you have the ability to fork a repository, So you can work on it on your own, without altering the original files.
3. 


#### Submission Folder
During prairie you will have to do some exercise to get key. those exercise will have to be pushed in a submission folder.
The Submission Folder is present in Coditech Github. 

We will fork it.
