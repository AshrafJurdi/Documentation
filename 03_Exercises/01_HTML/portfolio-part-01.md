# Portfolio Exercise

In this exercise, you will be replicating the same website using different technologies 

We're going to build a portfolio web page that will showcase your blog/services/products...

## Pre-requisites

The minimum requirement for this exercise is basic HTML. However, the exercise can be done using any front-end technology.

You can refer to w3schools tutorials [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) in order to learn or verify the HTML syntax.

## Goals

- Create a full portfolio
- Practice writing any front-end language you like
- **Pages**: 
  - <kbd>Home(About)</kbd>
  - <kbd>Blog/Services/Products</kbd>
  - <kbd>Contact</kbd>

## Instructions

- Fork this repo
- Clone it on your laptop
- Install Visual Studio Code

### HTML PART I

In this part of the exercise, you will develop the three pages mentioned above using only HTML (no styling, no features): 
1. Create a **Home** page that includes information about you (name, title, bio, picture, education, experience)
2. Create a **Blog/Services/Products** page that includes:
  - <kdb>Websites/Apps you developed (if you're a developer)</kdb>
  - <kdb>Posts you wrote (if you're a blogger)</kdb>
  - <kdb>Products you sold(if you're a seller)</kdb>
3. Create a **Contact** page that includes your contact info (phone number, email address, location) and a contact form
4. Create a **Menu** that can be used to navigate between the pages, and include it in all the pages
8. Commit ("HTML") ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘

### CSS PART II

In this part, you will design the previously developed portfolio
1. Change font families, font sizes, colors
2. Align the content of the pages and change width and height of each part
3. Add images and background images
4. Commit ("CSS") ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘

### React PART III

Wow! You've reached this part, you must be good. Well, here's a hard one.

In this part, you will migrate the previously developed portfolio from HTML & CSS ==> React
1. Use create-react-app command
2. For each part of the website, create a component. For example, if you have a header, slider, container and a footer in your hompage, each should be a component. You will find out here that one of the benefits of React is code reusability (ex. using 1 header code for all pages)
3. Use react-router to navigate between the pages
4. Commit ("React") ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘
